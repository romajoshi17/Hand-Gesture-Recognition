# Prodigy_ML_04
This project focuses on building a hand gesture recognition model using Convolution Neural Networks (CNN).

The dataset is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog/data. The database is composed by 10 different hand-gestures that were performed by 10 different subjects (5 men and 5 women).

## Features
- Data collection and pre-processing
- Building and training a CNN model
- Tesing the acuracy of the model on unseen testing data
- Use of evaluation metrics like accuracy
